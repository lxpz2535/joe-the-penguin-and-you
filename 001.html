    <title>Joe the Penguin and You</title>

    <h1>Time for a Vacation?</h1>
    <p>Antarctica is cold. Really, really cold. But it's your home and you love it because you are a penguin. You live here with your family and friends, and your best friend is named Joe. Joe is not like other penguins. While all other penguins never think
        about leaving Antarctica - they are content to play games with each other on the ice and snow, and swim and fish in the ocean - Joe has ideas of traveling.</p>
    <p>
        You have known Joe all your life. In fact, you were born the same year. All through the dark and bitter cold winter, your fathers carried you on their feet and kept you warm and snug under their bellies. At first you were in your egg, and didn't know
        much of anything, but soon you hatched and met Joe for the first time. You have been best friends ever since.
    </p>
    <p>Joe is special for another reason too. He's the fastest swimmer in all of Antarctica. No other penguins can swim half as fast as Joe, and penguins are, as you know, very fast swimmers - in fact, it's more like flying than swimming. He can swim so
        fast, that in the blink of an eye, he can go from one end of your penguin village to the other. You have always wondered if that's one reason Joe has thought of traveling so much.</p>
    <p>One day, late in the fall of the year, you were hanging out with Joe at the edge of the ice looking North. Well, pretty much any way you look from Antarctica is North, but in this case you were looking North towards the southern most tip of South
        America. Joe turned to you and said, "I think I need a vacation. I'm tired of spending the cold dark winter in Antarctica. I think I'm going North for the winter. Do you want to come with me?"</p>
    <p>Do you say, <a href="002.html">"Yes. Let's take a vacation together!"</a></p>
    <p>or</p>
    <p>Do you say, <a href="003.html">"No. I don't like adventures. I'm going to stay here."</a></p>
