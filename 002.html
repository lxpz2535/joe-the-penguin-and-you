    <h1>Adventure of a lifetime!</h1>
    <p>You decide to stay by your best friend's side and take a vacation together. You dive into the water and swim off north, not knowing exactly where you are going, and not exactly caring. You eventually find your way all the way to the Caribbean, and
        experience warm weather and warm water for the first time. You see white sand beaches, and meet exotic and interesting creatures.</p>
    <p>You stay in the Caribbean for the entire winter, and return to Antarctica the following spring. Some penguins thought you would return, but most thought you had died a tragic death soon after you left the ice since no one had ever done it before,
        they were sure it would end badly.</p>
    <p>When you returned from the north with all the amazing stories about sharks, and whales, and sea stars, and white sand beaches and warmth, you were the most popular penguins in all of Antarctica.</p>
