    <h1>Regrets of a lifetime!</h1>
    <p>You decide to stay in Antarctica and let your friend go off on vacation alone. He dived into the water at once and swam off at top speed. Within seconds he was so far north that he looked like a little black speck in the vast ocean. Within a minute,
        he was gone.</p>
    <p>You wondered what his vacation would be like. Would it be fun? Would it be dangerous? Would he meet interesting creatures along the way? All winter long you thought about Joe, and wondered if he was thinking about you. Many penguins were sure he was
        dead. Since no one had ever left Antarctica before, they were sure he would be killed within days of leaving. A few, however, thought that he was smart enough to keep out of trouble, and fast enough to swim away from any danger he met.</p>
    <p>One spring day you were standing at the edge of the ice looking north, and you noticed a little speck of black in the distance. You couldn't be sure, but you thought, maybe, just maybe, that was Joe returning home. As you watched, the speck drew closer
        and closer and was moving much faster than the ocean current. Sure enough, it was Joe! He was returning home afterall.</p>
    <p>The news of Joe's return spread quickly and everyone gathered around to hear his stories. He had amazing stories. Stories about sharks, and whales, and sea stars and warm air and water so warm that it was difficult to describe. He talked about white
        sand beaches that looked like ice and snow, but was almost too hot to walk on. All the other penguins wanted to hang out with Joe and hear his stories again and again. Joe's new found popularity was difficult for you to handle. He had new friends
        and new things to do, and you saw him seldom after that. You remember the day you decided to stay home instead of going on vacation wtih him, and you regretted that decision for the rest of your life.</p>
