I'm learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript with my daughter, and this repository is going to be used throughout our lessons to manage our work. I'm really enjoying this so far!

## Lesson 1:
- Create index.html and style.css using notepad. Explore font styles, colors, text alignment.
- Create a new page, and add a link to it from the index.html
- Install Visual Studio Code and open the folder to add more pages and links
- Create a GitHub account and a new repository
- Follow the GitHub Hello World tutorial
- Create a new branch for the intial commit of the story
- Publish the website on GitHub pages
